# React Compound Component Pattern Examples

This repository demonstrates the power and flexibility of the React Compound Component Pattern through practical examples. The Compound Component Pattern enhances component composability and reusability by allowing tight coupling of components without sacrificing their independence.

## What is the Compound Component Pattern?

The Compound Component Pattern is a design pattern in React that improves component composability and reusability. It involves a set of components working together as a cohesive unit, where a parent component shares its state and functionality with its children implicitly via context or cloning, rather than through explicit props. This pattern is especially useful for building complex UI components such as accordions, tabs, dropdowns, and more, offering a scalable and maintainable architecture.

## Examples Included

This repository contains the following examples of the Compound Component Pattern:

- **Dropdown Menu**: A versatile dropdown menu component that toggles visibility of its content.
- **Accordion**: A straightforward accordion component that allows for expanding and collapsing of sections.
